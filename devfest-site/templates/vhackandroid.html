				<h1>Android's 5th Birthday Celebration: European Best-of-Best
					Hackathon Series</h1>
				<hr>

				<p class="lead">Android became public on November 5th, 2007.
					That means it'll be 5 years of Android this November (2012)! Can't
					let this go by unnoticed! So the developer user groups
					(GDGs/GTUGs/AUGs) decided to organize an Android app hackathon
					tournament (think GADC but with higher stakes).</p>

				<p class="lead">In September/October 2012 you can participate in
					a local hackathon organized by your GTUG. Each winning team
					receives a chance to defend their user group in a final European
					hackathon in London. We pay your flight and hotel. This TopGun
					hackathon takes place on the weekend of October 26th-28th, right
					after Droidcon London.</p>

				<p class="lead">Android developers from all over Europe will
					come together from tens of locations and hack for 48 hours -
					nonstop! Prizes are to be announced.</p>

				<p class="lead">You can follow the livestream of the major
					events in September and on October 26th-28th or interact with us
					during public Hangouts here on Google+. Our developer wiki has a
					list of hacks.</p>

							applications for mobile phones. We partner with app developers to
							help them make more money from their free apps by introducing
							search monetization to the mobile world. We know that most
							Android app developers aren’t generating real revenue from their
							apps. Current monetization options such as in-app ads and
							freemium result in a bad user experience (viewing ads while using
							an app) and with no substantial revenue. We are striving to help
							these developers generate real revenue while improving the user
							experience of their end users. We know that these are no easy
							goals. So far we are well on our way, with some incredible
							numbers achieved during our beta test. Are you an Android
