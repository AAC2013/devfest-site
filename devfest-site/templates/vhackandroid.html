				<p class="about-text">
				Android became public on November 5th, 2007. That means it'll be 
				5 years of Android this November (2012)! Can't let this go by unnoticed!
				So the developer user groups (GDGs/GTUGs/AUGs) decided to organize an Android 
				app hackathon tournament (think GADC but with higher stakes).
				</p>
				
				<p class="about-text">
				In September/October 2012 you can participate in a local hackathon organised by your GTUG. 
				Each winning team receives a chance to defend their user group in a final 
				European hackathon in London. We pay your flight and hotel. This TopGun hackathon takes 
				place on the weekend of October 26th-28th, right after Droidcon London.
				</p>
				
				<p class="about-text">				
				Android developers from all over Europe will come together from tens of locations 
				and hack for 48 hours - nonstop! Prizes are to be announced.
				</p>
				
				<p class="about-text">				
				You can follow the livestream of the major events in September and on October 26th-28th or 
				interact with us during public Hangouts here on Google+. Our developer wiki has a list of hacks.
				</p>
