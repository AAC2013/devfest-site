						<p class="about-text" style="text-align: justify">
							Founded in late 2010, StartApp came to life after its founders
							identified a major need from mobile app developers – making real
							revenue. <a href="http://www.startapp.com/">StartApp</a> is a new
							monetization and distribution platform focusing on free
							applications for mobile phones. We partner with app developers to
							help them make more money from their free apps by introducing
							search monetization to the mobile world. We know that most
							Android app developers aren’t generating real revenue from their
							apps. Current monetization options such as in-app ads and
							freemium result in a bad user experience (viewing ads while using
							an app) and with no substantial revenue. We are striving to help
							these developers generate real revenue while improving the user
							experience of their end users. We know that these are no easy
							goals. So far we are well on our way, with some incredible
							numbers achieved during our beta test. Are you an Android

							Living Labs have been characterised by the European Commission as

							innovation. A Living Lab employs four main activities: 1.
							Co-Creation: co-design by users and producers. 2. Exploration:
							discovering emerging usages, behaviours and market opportunities.
							3. Experimentation: implementing live scenarios within
							communities of users. 4. Evaluation: assessment of concepts,
							products and services according to socio-ergonomic,
							socio-cognitive and socio-economic criteria.
